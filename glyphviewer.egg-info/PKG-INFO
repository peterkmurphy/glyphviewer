        About
        -----
        
        **Glyphviewer** is a web application that analyses web font files. This app will 
        parse any web font file provided as input, and will display its general information
        (such as name and copyright details) to the user. Glyphviewer also provides a testbed
        where users can enter text, and have it displayed using the font. Finally, this 
        application can display the characters supported by the font along with their Unicode
        codepoints. A demonstration is available `here <http://www.pkmurphy.com.au/glyphviewer/>`_.
        
        Installation and Dependencies
        -----------------------------
        
        **Glyphviewer** depends on the following software:
        
        * `Python 2.x <http://www.python.org/>`_
        * `Django 1.x <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
        * The `FontTools <http://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools/>`_ package for parsing TrueType and OpenType files.
        * The `WoffTools <https://github.com/typesupply/woffTools>`_, package built on top of FontTools, for parsing WOFF files.
        * `Numerical Python (numpy) <http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/>`_, which is a dependency for both FontTools and WoffTools.
        
        Once these libraries have been installed, the next stage is to install **Glyphviewer** 
        from PyPI through the command:
        
            pip install glyphviewer
        
        The next stage is to add "glyphviewer" to your INSTALLED_APPS list in settings.py, 
        and add the desired URL in one of the urls.py files.
        
        The final stage is to populate the directory with fonts where you display your chosen font or fonts. 
        The Glyphviewer application comes with its own set of fonts adapted from the `Free UCS Outline Fonts <https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freefont/>`_; 
        they have been converted to WOFF form for quicker download. These can be moved into the correct directory via the following shell command:
        
            python manage.py collectstatic
        
        The font files wil then be moved into the {STATIC_ROOT}/glyphviewer/fonts/ directory, and the browser will 
        read the files from the {STATIC_URL}/glyphviewer/fonts/ folder.
        
        The HTML template files in this application have been redesigned to work with the 
        `Mezzanine <http://mezzanine.jupo.org/>`_ CMS. The redesign removed any explicit 
        references to particular stylesheets found with earlier versions. 
        The app (and the fonts) are released under a 
        `GNU general public license. <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html>`_ If you wish to do any changes,
        pop over to the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/peterkmurphy/glyphviewer>`_ for the app.
